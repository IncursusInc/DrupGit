# DrupGit
DrupGit will be a Drupal 8 module that will provide direct integration into GitHub. Features will include direct integration of commit logs, release information, as well as other project-related metadata. It will also feature pre-built Drupal blocks and views for ease of customization. In Phase 2, support will be added for GitLab.
